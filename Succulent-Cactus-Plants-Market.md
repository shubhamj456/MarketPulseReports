These include the potential for over-saturation in the retail market, supply chain disruptions, and the need for education on proper care for these plants. On the other hand, the opportunities for innovation in plant care, sustainable packaging, and new distribution channels (e.g., e-commerce platforms) provide ample prospects for market players.</p> <h3>Growth Potential: A 10-Year Forecast</h3> <p>The market's outlook from 2023 to 2033 suggests steady growth, with an estimated CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) of 7-10%. The demand for low-maintenance, drought-resistant plants will likely continue to rise, bolstered by shifting consumer preferences for sustainable and wellness-oriented lifestyles.
